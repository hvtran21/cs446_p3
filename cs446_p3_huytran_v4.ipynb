    "\n",
    "To implement the first component of `run_queries(document_fpath, query_fpath, trecrun_file)`, we want to read in the tokenized and stemmed document collection provided and build an inverted index. Here are some things you will probably want to take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The documents are provided as a list of json dictionary objects.\n",
    "- Because of the pre-processing we have done for you, term vectors should be constructed by splitting the text field's value by spaces (the regex \\\\s+), and ignoring blank strings. You've already shown you can tokenize, stop, and stem, so we're making it easier for this project.\n",
    " - Note that the processing in this case did not squeeze apostrophes out: instead, they were treated as word separators. That means that the word `quaker's` has resulted in tokens `quaker` and also `s`. Similarly, you'll find `t` (from `don't`) and `ve` (from `I've`) and so on as tokens. You will handle them as if they were normal words: do not remove them! That way the phrase query `\"quaker s\"` (see Part II) should find the word `quaker's` (and also `quaker s'truth` if by some weird chance that appeared in the stories).\n",
    "- Note that the index includes Unicode characters, but you should not worry about them even if they create odd tokens. Tokens are whatever is separated by a whitespace.\n",
    "- You need to build a simple inverted index with count and positional information: a combination of Figure 5.4 (p.134) and Figure 5.5 (p.135) in the textbook. (Depending on how you store things, the count may come along for free with the position information.) While you may store your index to disk to enable reuse, it is not required: an in-memory only index is sufficient for the project. (Your decision may be made partly by how long it takes to process the full collection in your implementation. It should be fast.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here are some recommendations regarding the data structures you will use behind these functions to implement the indea. You can use whatever data structures you feel are appropriate to implement these functcions, however, you may find these ideas helpful. We will not explicitly test your data structures.\n",
    "  - We recommend having the data storage behind your inverted index being of a form similar to **Dict[str, List[Posting]]**. Other data structures are plausible but are unlikely to provide any particular value for this project.\n",
    " - You might define a **PostingList** class that provides the **List[Posting]** datatype. Mostly that would help abstract away the implementation of the list.\n",
    " - **Posting** might be a **DocId** and **Positions** pair, so that a dictionary is used to find inverted lists and the inverted list is a list of \"Postings.\" It might also include the count of postings in that document.\n",
    " - **Positions** might be a **List[int]** or **array** of integers\n",
    " - **For the sake of efficiency (string comparisons are slow)** and memory usage, we encourage you to encode document numbers as integers, not using the *storyID* textual field. Otherwise you will not be able to answer analysis questions about compression. However, note that you will still need to be able to convert a document number back into its corresponding *storyID* for the TREC run output file. For example: getStoryID(1) would be “8951-id_1” since that's the first story in *sciam.json.gz*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We suggest you think ahead (see [processing queries](#query-processing) below) and ensure your index can access the vocabulary, term counts, document counts and other statistics that you will need to perform the query evaluation activities. Thinking this through now will save some headaches later.\n",
    "\n",
    " - You will be writing code to handle arbitrary (but simple) queries for phrases and terms. That means your code will benefit from being general in how it handles them. You will likely find it best to have a method that allows any number of terms and/or phrases and does not depend on knowing what those terms and/or phrases will be or even how many there will be. Here are a couple of tips or ideas that may or may not help your thinking:\n",
    "   - You will be implementing scoring functions and models that produce scores that are not just integers. Put some time into it now (read ahead!) to ensure that your inverted index provides everything that is needed for those operations -- e.g., the number of terms, the number of documents, and so on. What do you think you might need to store and where would it make sense to store it?\n",
    "   - Would it benefit you to define helper functions for processes such as counting phrases and terms?\n",
    "   - Can you implement terms as phrases of length 1? That is, have one function that handles phrases and single terms that doesn't care whether there are 1 or 32 terms in the phrase. That provides a cleaner abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the stub of a helper function that can be implemented to build and return an inverted index for `run_queries(document_fpath, query_fpath, trecrun_file)`. You are not required to use this, and it will not be graded."

Sorting in reverse order by the negative scores will put higher probabilities at the start of the list as you want.\n",

If there are documents with the same score, break the tie by sorting those by the storyID textual field's value (as a string, ignoring that it looks like a number in some ways -- i.e., “11-x” comes before “2-x”). Similarly, '21081-article1' comes before '8952-id_63'.\n",
